Trace
=====

is a markup program for text on the internet.
It allows you to turn ordinary text into hyperlinks
pointing to whichever websites you damn well choose.
Trace is writen in Coffeescript with CSS done in Stylus
and the server in Node.  Underscore.js makes a single
appearance, and jQuery is used pretty extensively.
If anyone has any better ideas how to deal with
Range objects, I'd love to hear!

Also, I apologize for the disorganization, I'm
still cleaning up house.  If you have any questions
feel free to ask.  lunde@math.ku.edu
